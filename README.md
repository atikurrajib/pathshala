<h1 align="center">Welcome to Pathshala!</h1>

**Pathshala** is a robust, full-stack Student Management System (SMS) designed to digitize and streamline academic administration. Built with a focus on high performance and security, it provides a centralized platform for managing student records, academic progress, and institutional data.

---

## Project Overview

Through **Pathshala**, we have developed a scalable solution for educational institutions to manage their day-to-day operations. The system ensures data integrity and provides real-time insights for administrators and teachers.

### Key Features:
* **Student Lifecycle Management:** Comprehensive records from admission to graduation.
* **Academic Tracking:** Manage classes, sections, subjects, and student attendance.
* **Result & Grading System:** Automated grade calculation and report card generation.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Distinct portals and permissions for Admins, Teachers, and Students.
* **Financial Management:** Tracking student fees, payments, and financial history.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend (Server-Side Templating)
* **Templating Engine:** Go `html/template` (Standard Library)
* **Architecture:** Modular Layouts (Header, Sidebar, Footer partials).
* **Styling:** Custom CSS / Tailwind CSS.
* **Client-Side:** Vanilla JS & **Chart.js** for administrative data visualization.

### Backend (Server Side)
* **Language:** Golang (Go)
* **Architecture:** **Repository Pattern** for scalability and testing.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Handled via internal/driver and dbrepo).
* **Security:** Session-based Auth, Bcrypt password hashing, and CSRF protection.

### Infrastructure & DevOps
* **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose.
* **Database Versioning:** SQL Migrations (stored in `/migrations`).
* **Automation:** **Makefile** for streamlined development workflows.

## System Architecture

Pathshala is built as a **Structured Monolith** using **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**. The architecture follows the **Repository Pattern**, which decouples the business logic from the data storage layer, making the system highly maintainable and easy to test.

### Technical Highlights:

1.  **Repository Pattern:** Decouples business logic from SQL queries, ensuring the codebase is scalable and database-agnostic.
2.  **Server-Side Templating:** Utilizes Go’s `html/template` for secure, high-performance rendering of the student dashboard and admin panels.
3.  **Database Design:** Advanced relational schema designed for data normalization, managed through version-controlled SQL migrations.
4.  **Security First:** Implementation of session-based authentication, Bcrypt password hashing, and custom middleware for granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
5.  **Concurrency:** Utilizes Go’s Goroutines for efficient background processing and non-blocking report generation.

##  Future Roadmap
* [ ] **Parent Portal:** Dedicated mobile-responsive view for parents to track child progress.
* [ ] **Automated Notifications:** Email/SMS integration for attendance and fee alerts.
* [ ] **Exam Management:** Modules for online MCQ exams and scheduling.
